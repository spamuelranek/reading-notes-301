## [Peer Programing](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)
1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
  1. Greater Efficiency
  2. Engaged Collaboration
  3. Learning from fellow students
  4. Social Skills
  5. Job interview readiness
  6. Work environment readiness

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
- Learning from fellow students
  - The times I have peer programmed, it has helped me see problems in different ways with different solutions. It also turn me toward new lines of even how to think about a problem.

3. How does pair programming work?
- It works by having a Driver and a Navigator.
  - The Driver: One putting code on to the page
  - The Navigator: One building the metaphorical code and design
    - e.g. Driver is sharing screen and working on the code, and the Navigator is telling the Driver what to build towards while looking at the problem domain and structure

### Things I want to learn more about:
- runtime is a loose idea in my mind
- Engine makes things go so maybe it is the same.
